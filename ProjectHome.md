What?

Neutron is a plugin-based Jabber bot that provides functionalities for individuals and chatrooms.
It is written in Python and uses xmpppy.

Why?

Comparing to other python bots, neutron has smallest size, and feature-full
functionality, plus it runs out of the box with bundled dependencies.
Only working Python required.


Issues?

Yes, a lot. Major one is still outdated and buggy version of XMPPPY.
One of the ways is to replace it with Gajim's fork, which is up-to-date,
and both users of Neutron and Gajim should benefit.

Workflow? Any?

The most beautiful redesign did elghinn, gh0st-dev contains pretty mess
of plugins and other fancy things, and only trunk version is official.
